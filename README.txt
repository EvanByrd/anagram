The program can be run in the command line.

If in the same directory simply run the command "./anagram" and the program will attempt to run.

The program will attempt to find dictionary.txt from within its own directory by default, but a new path can be designated using the "dict" flag followed by the file directory.

For example:
	./anagram dict New_Path1/New_Path2/Different_Dictionary.txt

The above commange will attempt to look for the anagram program within the current directory and then search for the dictionary file inside of the newly specified directory.
